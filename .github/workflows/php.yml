      # FIXME:
      # - Without 'continue-on-error', it means the commit-level status indicator
      #   in commit logs, file history, and PR overview will be marked as
      #   failure (even if PR requirements allow Phan to fail), which is confusing
      #   and can also cause email spam.
      # - With 'continue-on-error' it means the build is falsely marked as passing.
      #   and you have to click two times, scroll down, click once more to find out
      #   whether it is still failing or not. This is the least-worst of option for
      #   now, but go complain at <https://github.com/actions/toolkit/issues/399>
      #   for GitHub to implememnt a reasonable "allow failure" job-level option.
